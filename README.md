## Why did you bother making this?

It was about 15 minutes for fun and I was too lazy to think of different keywords
plugins with this purpose would use (I only found one from 2014).

## Config

| Key       | Type      | Default   | Description   |
| -----     | ---       | ---       | ----------    |
| `damage`  | double    | 1         | The amount of damage the snowball should deal upon impact. |

## How do I use this?

Drop it into the `/plugins` folder of your [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) server.
Even though it was built for paper, it'll probably work using
[Spigot](https://spigotmc.org) and standard Bukkit too.
